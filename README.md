Understanding the trend of global production of food

“God comes to the hungry in the form of food” - Mahatma Gandhi. 
Today our agriculture is facing its most profound challenge in 10,000 years, with increasing world population and decreasing agricultural production. For every degree we heat the planet, the yields of staple cereal crops will decline by an average of about 10%. And as per World Bank the temperature in next decade is going to rise by 3-4 degrees, then the challenge is even bigger.
Along with productivity there is need to focus on crop diversity also. United States used to have 7100 crop varieties but now they are left with just 1000 varieties. It is important because when we lose diversity, we lose options for the future.
Thus, finding solutions for feeding the growing world population has become a hot topic for food and agriculture organisations, Entrepreneurs and Philanthropists.
                                To understand the problem of world agriculture and the need to change our ways of growing food, let’s have a look at the Global Food Supply data. For a better understanding of the data EDA was performed.
The data is on production of 115 items spread over 53 years (1961-2013) for 175 countries.

Later a deep dive is taken into it by comparing the productivity(Mean_production / arable land) of these countries. This is done for getting the countries which have good amount of land for 
agriculture but aren't producing enough. We can then relate to varoius factors which affect agriculture and find  the countries where there is a potential of increasing the production.
